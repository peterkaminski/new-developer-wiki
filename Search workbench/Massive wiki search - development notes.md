Software development steps (UX and back-end):

- include a search button on the navbar (first-order implementation)
	-  bring up a web-page with a search entry window
	-  display search results on this web-page
	-  include links to the wiki pages returned by the search
- second-order search features:

	- include some content surrounding the search terms
