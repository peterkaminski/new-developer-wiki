# Example Wikis (Non-Massive Wiki)

[Energypedia](https://energypedia.info/wiki/Main_Page)

- Clean-looking, well-maintained wiki, with decent "About Us" section. Looks like [[MediaWiki]] with a custom skin, which is sort of generic but nice. Tabs and sub-tabs (such as in the "About Energypedia" section) are clunky.
- Note the "request account" process and page: <https://energypedia.info/wiki/Special:RequestAccount>
