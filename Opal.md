# Opal

Also see: [[Zirconia]], [[Obsidian]].

Opal is a desktop (and probably web and mobile) front-end, or client, for Massive Wiki.

The idea is to have an easy-to-learn client, which presents an editing pane, a preview pane, and a way to view a list of pages, perhaps in "recently edited" order.

It should be able to search all pages, and provide wiki-linking capabilities like Obsidian.

It should have Git sync built into it; no separate Git install should be necessary.  It should make Git authentication and simple conflict resolution super easy for non-technical users.
