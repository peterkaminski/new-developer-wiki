# Jonathan Sand
I am an artist, a wandering engineer, a dreamer, an optimist.  I am ethically maturing. I prefer being reliable because it aids collaborating. I am not perfect, I am a work in progress. I love to think about things that are familiar to me. I like to move into new systems of thinking. I mostly know when to shut up and listen, not always. I am sensitive to what seems broken, a blessing and a curse.

I am an essentialist and relate that way to the world around me. Things, art, people, knowledge, ideas.

People are worth connecting to, tapping into the real stuff, substance. I am new to being in relationship rather than in transaction. What a relief, much easier. But I prefer one on one, especially when each spoken part is short.
