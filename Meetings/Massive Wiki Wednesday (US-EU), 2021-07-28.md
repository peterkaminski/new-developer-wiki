## EES, Covid Edition

- Mattermost channel? Factr? Massive Wiki?
- partly-refined information + context, _not_ necessarily accurate
    - should be signal, not noise
    - doesn't have to be perfect or even necessarily correct, but you should think it's important, and important to share
    - anecdotes can be important! make sure to note that it's anecdotal, though, and give a little context about what you think about the source
- personal responsibility for "notecards" added to the megastream
- develop a process of refining steps that make the information better and more organized
- transient
- info-stream, dipping ladle in a river, twitter feed (i see what i see, i don't go back and try to see everything)

### History

- "constructed ignorance"

## Massive Wiki Community Wikis

Need to make a map!

- "marcom" site
- user community
- developer community
- some kind of knowledgebase?

## GDM (G*** Docs to Massive)
- a sibling to Matrix-to-Massive
- the idea is to pull Google Docs in a particular folder, transform them to Markdown, and then put them into a folder in a Massive Wiki

## Opal

- Ionic (Electron, Web)
- Editor: MCEditor, CK Edit, Quill, SlateJS (used by Netlify CMS)?
