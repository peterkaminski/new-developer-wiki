- [Local Citation Network](https://timwoelfle.github.io/Local-Citation-Network/) - _This web app aims to help scientists with their literature review using metadata from Microsoft Academic, Crossref and OpenCitations. Academic papers cite one another, thus creating a citation network (= graph). Each node (= vertex) represents an article and each edge (= link / arrow) represents a reference / citation._
