## Massive Pitch

- record an hour (or two) of video, then collectively garden the interesting bits out
- Bill's haiku notes
- what did we hear
- what was "said", but not actually spoken
- [[Tavistock]], [[social dreaming]]
    - cf. [[collective presencing]]

## Observing

- there's a lot of friction
    - startup piece, obviously
    - e.g., needs a lot of curation
    - need to ideate/learn how to/iterate structure information

## Outreach

- build / do something useful for a community
- aspirational documentary, e.g., three communities, sensorica, p2pfoundation, cicolab, peeragogy, etc. being able to come together
- collecting and distilling CICOLAB wraps

## Wishlist

- super quick annotations
- commenting 
- more sharing

## GitHub authentication

- Pete to try Bill's instructions on Windows and Mac
