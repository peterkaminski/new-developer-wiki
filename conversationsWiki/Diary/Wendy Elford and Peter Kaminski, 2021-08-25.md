# Wendy Elford and Peter Kaminski, 2021-08-25

## Culture

Wendy's observation: We need to slow down to speed up.

(cf. [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.]])

It's about exchanges.

## Privacy

When we make recordings and transcripts, we want to have a practice of asking at the beginning if it's okay to record, and at the end, if it's okay to publish the audio and the transcript, and if the participants want to approve the artifacts before they are published.

(Contrast with [[Chatham House Rules]].)

## Production Issues

Where do audio files get saved? Or do they get deleted after they are transcribed?
