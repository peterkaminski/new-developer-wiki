# Wendy Elford, Bill Anderson, and Peter Kaminski, 2021-08-24

Bill joined Wendy and Pete on one of their regularly scheduled calls, and we talked about [[Conversations]] and stuff (meta-Conversations, etc.).

We took notes at [CSC Mattermost/~Conversations](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/gwi7e4o6pp8btmwt1q3up3pqqc) et seq.

We recorded a section of the conversation as well, and Wendy transcribed it: [[WE_PK_BA_210824.docx]] (and converted to [[WE_PK_BA_210824.html]]).

## Intentions

Pete will make a screencast of how to add an artifact from a conversation (using Wendy's transcription as an example) to the wiki.
