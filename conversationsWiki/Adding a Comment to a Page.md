# Adding a Comment to a Page

We suggest a way to add a comment inline in a page.

The idea is to use a quoted block and (perhaps) your name, and then add your comments.

For replies, you can add another quote level (line starts with `> > `).

Consider a passage of text like the following.

## Example Source Text

I think we can level up from being an oral culture that thinks big thoughts but doesn't do much else together, to being a culture that uses technologies like reading and writing and drawing to create persistent artifacts and thinking spaces.

one of the collective wishes we have is "wouldn't it be cool if an expert or a genius took our calls and made something wonderful out of them?"

while I don't disagree with that wish, I think we can get a **lot** of the same value by doing that making ourselves.  *and*, that we would learn more and think more together, by doing it ourselves, rather than depending on an external specialist to do it for us.  and heck, some of *us* might become experts and geniuses at distilling knowledge and wisdom, if only we started practicing what we wish for!

> (Ondine) You note this has been said about calls; I feel that the same can be said about conversations in other media, as well.
