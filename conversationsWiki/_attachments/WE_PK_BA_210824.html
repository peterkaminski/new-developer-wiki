<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:00:00]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> Um, I don't know that I have
anything to say.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:00:19]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> Um, I can't, I'm going to
encourage you. What about the jumping around piece and the channels that Bill
shared?</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:00:29]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> Um, I, uh, so, so Bill had
shared that it feels nowadays, like we're having. Conversations that start in a
channel that does is' isn't appropriate and may or may not end up bridging over
to another channel and may or may not end up getting to the channel that it
should actually be going on and to the point where he doesn't even know like
something simple, like I wonder where I could talk about this text sniper tool
that's so cool. Does that go in tools, <span style='color:gray'>[00:01:00]</span>
and technology, or does it go someplace else where we started? Does it go on
textual? Does it go on? So, um,</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:01:06]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> That's exactly my problem
yesterdaythe, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:01:18]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> so it, I guess it, it can feel
confusing, um, and not safe to start talking and not feel like you're in the
right place or that people are going to be listening to you or the right.
People are being amazed. Listen to you. But another way I think of it is that
even if we have,</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:01:43]</span> I guess, let me back
up a sec. Um, my observation from watching people use email for a long time.
Um, we used to have, uh, uh, netiquette that said you should change the subject
lines of your emails when the subject changes in the email. And <span
style='color:gray'>[00:02:00]</span> a few of us pedants could do that. Um,
very few people could actually do it.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:02:05]</span> Um, and it, it's not
reflective of the way people really work because, uh, it's really common. They
have not one subject, uh, in an email, but like 10, um, and they shift. And
it's hard to tell when you go from one subject to another subject, um, natural
conversations are not sure. Um, that's uh, but yeah, if you want chunking to
happen, I guess, so then if you want chunking to happen, you kind of have to
chunk, uh, after the fact, rather than during the fact.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:02:48]</span> So then you need
tools and processes to manage that. So when I think of there's like, it's easy,
it's easy to say. And some people do say this too <span style='color:gray'>[00:03:00]</span>
many channels in this chat system. There's too many conversations. I don't know
where the conversations are happening. Um, it makes me want to throw up my
hands.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:03:08]</span> I think that. I look
at that the other way around the glass, I can look at a kind of glass, half
full thing and say, these conversations are happening and maybe they're not
quite in the right place, or maybe they're not quite structured the right way,
but thank goodness that we're having the conversations.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:03:26]</span> Um, so, um, one
solution, which I think is a bad solution is to say, well, we're going to be
thread Nazis and. You can only talk about certain things in certain channels.
Um, and we'll kick you over to the other channel if you're not in the right place.
Um, that's a poor solution. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:03:46]</span> Um, another
solution, the more generative solution I think is to have a.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:03:56]</span> Has kind of a group <span
style='color:gray'>[00:04:00]</span> social group social awareness. I was going
to say self-awareness, um, uh self-awareness and in a social sounds of things
that are happening and. Mention to people could you also cross post that to a
different channel or, um, in another channel you might say, Hey, there's an
interesting conversation happening over here.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:04:23]</span> So, and then, uh, even
better than that is kind of what we have promised ourselves to do with the
Wiki, the conversation wiki but we haven't quite gotten to yet start garden
conversations into uh, into curated and, um, uh, less chaotic places. So the,
the kind of thing I like to see happen is, um, I called it for OGM forum.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:04:52]</span> I called it beat
reporting. Um, uh, it would be really cool if somebody got paid actually, uh, <span
style='color:gray'>[00:05:00]</span> to kind of watch what was going on, uh, in
the channels over the course of a week and write up a little newspaper. Uh,
broadsheet, you know, um, Bill's talking about, uh, text over here and Bentley
is talking about, um, the, the zoom chat formater are over there.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:05:20]</span> Uh, and Hey, a
reminder folks, public service reminder, here's where you go to talk about
certain things or feature channel this week is textual and things that happen
in textual and maybe the things that shouldn't happen in textual, they should
happen in tools and technology or in coffee shop or, or whatever.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:05:38]</span> So, so in general,
we can make things better by, um, adding overhead functions, um, and reflective
functions. Um, and. In our society over the past 20 or 25 years, we try not
really hard not to do that. Um, it's a general, general purpose <span
style='color:gray'>[00:06:00]</span> problem. Uh, it happens everywhere. Yeah. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:03]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> Could you go back and say that
again, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:04]</span> please?</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:06]</span> Uh, which part.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:10]</span> Um,</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:14]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> can I just say that if you don't
actually have to repeat it because we know we've got it. And I think that
should be part of our process is said </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:23]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> okay. To be, I think
self-reflective during. Um, so I, I think that we're not doing and it's
happened, you know, I feel like netiquette used to kind of help people be more
self-reflective and.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:06:37]</span> And help each other
in society in general, um, over the past 20 years or so. Um, and especially
our, our experiences with technology companies like Google have learned that
they can abdicate customer support, um, and replace it <span style='color:gray'>[00:07:00]</span>
with essentially automation. Um, so if you're having a problem with Google,
Google is going to notice that some subset of all of their users are having
that problem and they're going to fix it without you asking them</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:07:13]</span> and without them
telling you that they fixed it. Um, uh, society has become self-service and
we've all been compartmentalized into having to do self-service on our
computers. Um, and with the web. We have to figure out what's wrong and we have
to fix it. And so we've lost this kind of social interface, social, um, social
care that I feel like we used to have more and especially in community,
computer media com communications, we've learned not to have it, so we don't
have reflective intervals after we talk. And after we have conversations, a
great example of this is the OGM there's. <span style='color:gray'>[00:08:00]</span>
Where each call is super generative and covers a lot of topics and, and
actually it gets recorded and the chats get saved and those don't get back, get
back nobody gets back to those to harvest them. Um, and I'm not picking on OGM
or the Thursday calls. Um, that is a really. Example of this. It's happening
everywhere, you know, so it's, it's what we've been doing it with what happens
at Mattermost there's a flurry of conversations that flutter around and fall
like snow. And nobody goes around to do the gardening afterward to make, um,
second order learning in third order learning.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:08:45]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> Okay. Okay. So this is really, I
think really great because I think just the process of saying things and I love
the fact I've ha I've seen this so many times as you say that you haven't got
anything to <span style='color:gray'>[00:09:00]</span> contribute and you just
gave the greatest piece of information. It was really good. I think this is
powerful.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:09:06]</span> Um, and so what we
need now to do is to say the, what we would do, and we've got 15 minutes maybe
to do it is how do we, how do we put a bit of will to actually do the thing
that we say we're going to do, which is to bring this to some sort of
reflection point because we have got the recording and I know there will be odd
bits and pieces there.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:09:29]</span> Um, part of the
challenge, I'm just talking second. Order learning here. And this is a tool
thing is getting good transcriptions and this work and time in that. Um, but I
don't think we will make good progress as a group or a team or as individuals
unless we sort of double down on what we know independently here.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:09:51]</span> Um, keeping these
exchanges going is really important. Um, and. I think that the <span
style='color:gray'>[00:10:00]</span> technical part of actually getting a good
transcript, um, is a little tricky, but Otter doesn't do too bad a job. We
could throw that in. I mean, all of us are quite articulate as we add diction
is good. So Otter often doesn't do too bad a job, but I would say that
someone's got to spend an hour cleaning up or, maybe half an hour, cleaning up
a transcript.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:10:27]</span> So we've got 20
minutes worth how much time since we started recording? 15, 10, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:10:34]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> probably 15, I would guess.
And different thing to do. Um, uh, maybe a complimentary thing to do. Uh, we've
got typed notes. Um, and the way I would process these natively is to bring up
Scapple um, Uh, Wendy do you might use Miro and just start throwing some of the
key phrases, <span style='color:gray'>[00:11:00]</span> um, onto a map and then
start to connect them and </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:11:04]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> decorate.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:11:04]</span> See if I do it on
Miro, you bring up scaffold. What I'll do is I'll get the conversation and see
if Miro will actually turn that into little pasted notes. Um, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:11:16]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> I don't, I don't think I would
I don't think I would paste it wholesale. Um, I might, uh, collaboratively,
like that's what I would do is talk through, uh, have one person show their map
and talk through the notes and capture things, um, on essentially a shared
whiteboard.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:11:37]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> Yeah. I think, I think both have
value, different things turn up, but I'm just from a tech point of view. I just
want to try and throw mud on the wall. You start the, the other one, you start
the Scapple one and I'll start the other one. And we'll see what turns up
because anything is better than nothing. <span style='color:gray'>[00:12:00]</span>
And at least we've made one step forwards with three people who care.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:12:11]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> So Pete, in response to your
description of how. Things are multi-channel and kind of all over in
Mattermost. I mean, I know, you know, this piece about putting links in
different places is something that can be learned. Doesn't seem to be too
difficult. Maybe that's something I should just do. Just figure out how to take
the work and do it.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:12:40]</span> Which creates a kind
of blink thing. So that's nice. And I agree with you. I don't think we should.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:12:48]</span> I don't think we
should. If we want to see what will happen, we have to let see what will happen
here. I think the idea of trying to do, we're going to put all the tools stuff
together under this big tool umbrella, we'll <span style='color:gray'>[00:13:00]</span>
make a very, just, everything will be imprecise.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:13:08]</span> Yep. Um, I would say
the fact that it makes me uneasy is okay, but, um, for me, it's not so much
that I'm worry about where should I put it although sometimes I do. Mostly it's
like, where would the, where does, where would it be valuable? Yeah. You know,
I use the coffee shop for stuff. I get at the coffee shop I think like we
should all listen to this little post from Mary Oliver and this is the kind of
thing I would do in a coffee shop.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:13:39]</span> So that's what I'm
using that for. Um, in fact, I should write this down. I've got to go back
right. Last night, I had a very big struggle, big from posting something and I
almost put it in off topic, but I somehow felt it wasn't even appropriate for
Mattermost and I should dig that out and find out why.<span style='color:gray'>[00:14:00]</span>
</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:14:02]</span> And then I didn't, I
thought maybe you should be in Metta and I'm like, I. I. So this might be a
thing about not feeling safe. I don't really care if somebody says, yeah, well,
Bill, you know, so I found a bender of air in the corner was all right. I don't
care about that, but it's trying to like, could there be some value, some value
to do this?</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:14:25]</span> Because I feel like
we're in this world that, you know, this online world that you hinted at Wendy
and your comments of all these little pieces and parts. And I would, I don't
know, we have to be able to make sense of being there. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:14:46]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> And I, I do think that these
reflections that we're having are helping, because I'm thinking, are you an
engineer by job? What job were you doing? </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:14:57]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> I was a software <span
style='color:gray'>[00:15:00]</span> engineer for Xerox. I studied chemistry
for 10 years and got a PhD in theoretical chemistry. Yes I was, but that would
be a scientist, I suppose. Um, and then I did some international development
pro bono work on scientific data policy. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:15:21]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> So in that I hear, um, I go back
to the tools that I use and we're, we're now five minutes into our not
gardening stories.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:15:30]</span> So we're going to
have to have some discipline around how we gate, keep around conversations. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:15:34]</span> <b><span
style='color:#FA8A3B'>Peter Kaminski:</span></b> But yeah, and the call's
ending in seven and a half minutes, which is about the time Bill has to go
anywhere. Yeah, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:15:40]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> that's right. So maybe we use it
because we jumped, we jumped into the thing that you've quite rightly are
experiencing, which I think is the well, I would want to honor is this piece
around, where does the conversation fit?</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:15:56]</span> What should
something be called and then stepping back and <span style='color:gray'>[00:16:00]</span>
thinking, I'm the observing that I'm uncomfortable about this, which is I think
a really important step and then saying, is it trust? Is it something else? Is
it to do with the fact. Maybe I'm broken and I'm not calling it the right
thing, which is a sort of angst, existential angst thing.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:16:17]</span> Um, and all these
things are stopping us. And I think that actually doubling down on some of
those would help us a lot because for example, um, with search and I know that
my father was an engineer. That's why I asked that question. Is this the
certainty? We want certainty that we're putting it in the right place or that
it's not going to cause disorder.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:16:38]</span> Um, and they're not
certainties that we can have, because it will get renamed later, you have a
conversation in an email and other things turn up, you know, Pete says he
hasn't got something to contribute and he gives us the greatest bit of value
and we are recording it and maybe we won't use something with it.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:16:57]</span> There's always
ironies and <span style='color:gray'>[00:17:00]</span> paradoxes and, um
Different things that turn up in these conversations. And that's why they're
really good conversations. But we do need a process that says time, let's go
back a little bit and see if we can make some rough shapes. So the next time
we're not dancing around trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:17:18]</span> When in actual fact
we were in quite a good place. Last time we just needed to double down on that
one thing. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:17:24]</span> So in five minutes,
you know, I've got a Miro board up and I've learnt from a technical point of
view that I need to know how much texts I can put up there if I do copy and
paste. And if I'd done that in an Excel, Spreadsheet.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:17:39]</span> If I'd written my
notes in an Excel spreadsheet, I know that I can just drag them across, onto
Miro and I have X number of, um, post-it notes. So that's the technical thing.
For mapping. It would make a lot of difference. And if I was actually typing
the notes where I was putting the lines if I was doing that in an Excel
spreadsheet.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:17:58]</span> If I did arrow down
type <span style='color:gray'>[00:18:00]</span> type arrow down top, top down
top, top, then I can put it across in Miro sheet for Scapple, what would you
need to do?</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:18:10]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> Well, for me, Scapple is more
like. A. Pete might be able to do this real time. I would use Scapple as, or I
would like take these notes. If I were going to do them, if I am kind of the
secretary this week, I'm going to produce the summary of the conversation. I
might then take notes and then put together. You know, pick terms kind of like
what Peter's done, pick terms, and then add in from the kind of minutes things
I thought were valuable to be written down because when I come and take
everything down. Yeah. </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:18:48]</span> <b><span
style='color:#D82292'>Wendy Elford:</span></b> But part of it is I was doing
sort of more real time word for word, but I think if we look back, there would
be a lot of times where we actually wrote the same thing.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:18:56]</span> Like, um, What was
the <span style='color:gray'>[00:19:00]</span> channel Nazis or whatever it was
they'd, they'd just phrases. And we're thinking, right. Do I want to be like
that? And the answer to the question is probably no, because we've used
language that forces us to make a decision about what we like. And if the
answer to the question is no, that we've got a different design to make. So if
it's then letting it spread across the different channels, because that's the
organic thing, and that is the metaphor I'm using, um, then you need a
different way of collecting it. And I think what we've just said, then in terms
of how we make sense of the conversation afterwards, I think the fact that it
took place in a place where we could go back and find it and we have recorded
it, we fought two artifacts we can use in design. One of which is scattered.
But Bill, would you rather have taken your notes in Scapple and not on the
channel? </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:19:51]</span> <b><span
style='color:#00D1B2'>Bill Anderson:</span></b> If I was just taking notes, I'd
just type in likethe channel is fine, you know? Cause I would just produce a
string of <span style='color:gray'>[00:20:00]</span> whatever. I mean a big set
of words. Then I would, then if I were going to write minutes, I'd go along
with the help.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:20:08]</span> I'd read this thing
three times and find out what, what would, what would. That's the trouble, you
know, when you do it and one person it is going to be here is how I see and
want to reflect what happened in this conversation. Because it's like, right. I
can't escape the fact that I'm going to pick, or this was really cool.</p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:20:29]</span> This phrase. and not
some other one., </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:20:33]</span> and what you hear
and remember is a part of where you were focusing at the time of the
conversation, but we still do have the real words. And so we've got the design
debt of Bill going back and understanding or revisiting the text three times
and then making another add artifact. We've got Wendy wanting to do a visual
mapping because I've got this screen that I need to then go back into to do my
version of that on a different tool. And <span style='color:gray'>[00:21:00]</span>
I know that I could have done it on Miro, but then it's not in the conversation
and it's not linear. And then we've got this design debt of the imperfect, um,

articulate. So we've got a couple of different departure points there, </p>

<p class=Script><span style='color:gray'>[00:21:20]</span> This would be a

we've got 90 seconds left. I'm just saying, we just say goodbye. </p>

make this about exchanges and keeping the exchanges survivable. And useful. So
it's the processes that get us that. So we could do reflection next time and
not add more content. There will be more content that <span style='color:gray'>[00:22:00]</span>
