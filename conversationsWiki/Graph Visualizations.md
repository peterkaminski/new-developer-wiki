# Graph Visualizations

## Pete's Assertions

- automated graphs are "noisy"; you really need a carefully curated and constructed view to make semantic sense
- unless you do a visualization really well (different line types and colors, labels, whatever)...
- my mental model of the information space of a well-developed wiki is richer than 2D or even 3D visualizations (until I have the "three-space" interactive cloud visualizer)

It's also true that visualizations have their use, but let's not overweight their importance.
