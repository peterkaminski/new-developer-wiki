- Setup for Wendy and Mark on Conversations wiki

## general discussion

### Intent for conversations wiki
- real people use real conversations - make a more conversational wiki
- currently we are adding to and commenting on pages
- Bill and Pete put the mattermost thread on the conversations wiki
- use a block quote to do a comment so inline there are notes within notes

Mark Carranza
has used wikis before - tries to recall how comments - one at the bottom of the page - date - name first comment first last last
inline comments - does not remember

Pete K
wikipedia - one page with second page

massive wiki is to use git as a central repository and somehow link different wikis through git - NO

pete mW to use markdown files to make a wiki
AND the files are shared and versioned
AND the way we do this currently with Git
has played around with NextCloud
This has shared version files in something like Sharepoint and it has a nice markdown editor
mostly we do it with Git
The wiki, each wiki exists in multiple places - on the computer as a local set of files 
AND render to static website
the way we collaborate - we all edit - pull and push
We have not had the. multiple wikis
Also wants to get to git branches and forks and folds
problem with or new thing for the wiki
Talk about what goes and does not
PeteK - is starting to copy files from one wiki to another
YAML front matter so you have a page history - more conversational than git commits

YAML - delimit it with --- so viewer knows whether to show it or not
AND the static site generator Pete built does something similar
