## VNC Observations

- affordances of the exchange and negotiation of the thinking - the rhythm of the use of the tool; select the location of the server to suit the interaction
- issues are 1. the platform - may not suit everyone and 2. the accessibility if not left on all the time - could be turned on and off with a web page - idle time account 3. Not a replacement for existing - is an evolution - take a tool which is not multiplayer naturally and co-brain, not just co-edit
- maybe use a better client on Mac, which would have better keyboard or window control?
