# Ontology (back to basics)
 - [[Peter Kaminski]]: Some back-to-basics, for my own edification from [CSC Agora](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/kjd3ngk8opriir3ph51pdtg4xy)

**Ontology (information science)** - Formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain. May or may not be hierarchical.

**Taxonomy** - A scheme of classification, especially a hierarchical classification, in which things are organized into groups or types.

Note that ontology (information science) is not the same as **ontology (philosophy)**, which deals with concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality.

Also see Tom Gruber's writeups of ontology (information science) from 1992/1993 and 2009:
- [What is an Ontology?](http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html) (1992/1993)
- [Definition of Ontology ](https://tomgruber.org/writing/definition-of-ontology) (2009)

And Kurt Cagle's compare/contrast of taxonomy and ontology:
- [Taxonomies vs. Ontologies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/03/24/taxonomies-vs-ontologies/) (2019)

And lastly an older paper, with nothing particularly pretty, but a good survey of many types of ontology visualization, [Ontology Visualization Methods â€“ A Survey](http://entrezneuron.googlecode.com/svn-history/r2/trunk/references/12-onto-vis-survey-final.pdf) (PDF) (2007)
